  BILBO (CONT’D)                (whisper)Goodbye.BILBO instantly vanishes. The party explodes into an uproar ...the crowd leaps to its feet.ANGLE ON: FRODO staring at the empty stool in disbelief.                                                  CUT TO:EXT. BAG END - NIGHTThe party is still in an excited uproar ... some 50 yards awayas we PAN across a moonlit lane to the front door of BAG END.Door opens, pulled by an invisible hand.INT. BAG END - NIGHTThe door quietly closes ... BILBO materializes as he pulls aplain gold ring off his finger. BILBO laughs as he tosses thering in the air, then places it in his pocket.ANGLE ON: BILBO emerges from the passage, carrying a walkingstick. He finds GANDALF looming over him.             GANDALFI suppose you think that was terriblyclever?             BILBOCome on, Gandalf. Did you see theirfaces?             GANDALFThere are many magic rings in thisworld, Bilbo Baggins, and none of themshould be used lightly.             BILBOIt was just a bit of fun. Oh, you’reprobably right, as usual.             BILBOYou will keep an eye on Frodo, won'tyou?(CONTINUED)27.
CONTINUED:                       GANDALF          Two eyes. As often as I can spare them.                       BILBO          I'm leaving everything to him.                       GANDALF          What about this ring of yours? Is thatstaying too?CLOSE ON: BILBO ... he gives GANDALF a look and nods towards themantelpiece.                       BILBO          Yes, yes, it's in an envelope ... over          there on the mantelpiece.GANDALF frowns at the empty mantelpiece ... BILBO suddenly feelshis waistcoat with a look of guilty surprise.                       BILBO (CONT’D)          No, wait. It’s here in my pocket. Isn't          that ... isn’t that odd, now? Yet,          after all, why not? Why shouldn't I          keep it?                       GANDALF          I think you should leave the Ring          behind, Bilbo. Is that so hard?                       BILBO          Well, no ... and yes. Now it comes to          it, I don't feel like parting with it.          It’s mine. I found it. It came to me!ANGLE ON: GANDALF LOOKS DOWN AT BILBO WITH RISING CONCERN.             GANDALFThere's no need to get angry.             BILBOWell, if I'm angry, it's your fault!It's mine. My own, my precious.             GANDALFPrecious? It's been called that before,but not by you.
