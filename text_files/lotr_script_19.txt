 GANDALF      (ominous)There are few who can ... the language isthat of Mordor, which I will not utterhere.Mordor?FRODO             GANDALFIn the common tongue, it says:“One Ring to rule them all. One Ring tofind them. One Ring to bring them alland in the darkness bind them.”INT. BAG END KITCHEN - NIGHTCLOSE ON: THE RING lies on FRODO’S simple kitchen table.                       GANDALF          This is the One Ring, forged by the          Dark Lord Sauron, in the fires of Mount          Doom ... taken by Isildur from the hand          of Sauron himself.                       FRODO                (quiet realization)          Bilbo found it ... in Gollum's cave.                       GANDALF          Yes. For sixty years, the Ring lay quiet          in Bilbo’s keeping, prolonging his life,          delaying old age ... but no longer,          Frodo. Evil is stirring in Mordor. The          Ring has awoken. It's heard its master's          call.AT THAT MOMENT: A FLEETING, LOW WHISPER OF BLACK SPEECH emanatesfrom the RING. FRODO looks at GANDALF, each knowing the otherhas heard it.                       FRODO          But he was destroyed ... Sauron was          destroyed.ANGLE ON: THE RING lies between them on the table.CUT TO:(CONTINUED)39.
CONTINUED:             GANDALFNo, Frodo. The spirit of Sauron endured.His life force is bound to the Ring andthe Ring survived. Sauron has returned.His Orcs have multiplied ... hisfortress of Barad-dûr is rebuilt in theland of Mordor. Sauron needs only thisRing to cover all the lands in thesecond darkness. He is seeking it,seeking it, all his thought is bent onit. For the Ring yearns, above all else,to return to the hand of its master:They are one, the Ring and the DarkLord. Frodo, he must never find it.SUDDENLY, FRODO scoops up the RING.                       FRODOAlright!INT. BAG END LIVING ROOM - NIGHTANGLE ON: FRODO hurriedly entering the living room.                       FRODO                (thinking fast)          We put it away, we keep it hidden! We          never speak of it again. No one knows          it’s here, do they?GANDALF shifts uncomfortably.                       FRODO (CONT’D)          Do they, Gandalf?GANDALF looks at FRODO sadly...                       GANDALF          There is one other who knew that Bilbo          had the Ring. I looked everywhere for          the creature Gollum, but the enemy          found him first.
