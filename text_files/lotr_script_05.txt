CAMERA TRACKS TO: A figure lies beneath the dappled sunlight ofan old tree. White flowers are scattered among the WELL seededgrasses. An idyllic setting at the end of a long hot summer ...the figure is reading a book.ON THE SOUNDTRACK: In the distance, growing louder ... over theGENTLE CLIP CLOP of an approaching cart and horse can be heardthe HUMMING OF A DEEP VOICE to the tune of “The Road Goes EverOn and On...”SUDDENLY! The figure in the grass sits up ... looking straightat CAMERA is a handsome young HOBBIT, with dark curly hair anddeep blue eyes. This is FRODO BAGGINS ... his EYES alight withEXCITEMENT! Tossing away the long stem of grass in his mouth,FRODO runs off.CUT TO:EXT. SHIRE LANE - DAYThe cart rattles along a leafy lane, driven by a stooped figurein GREY.INTERCUT WITH: SHOTS OF FRODO RUNNING ... CAREENING DOWN A HILL... JUMPING OVER LOGS ... DODGING TREE BRANCHES.ANGLE ON: The shambling OLD PONY snorts and rears as ...SUDDENLY FRODO appears on the bank above the cart.                       FRODO          You're late.CLOSE ON: GANDALF glowers at the young HOBBIT...                       GANDALF          A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins,          nor is he early. He arrives precisely          when he means to.They look at each other for a moment ... then both startlaughing as FRODO’S face breaks into a smile and he leaps on tothe front seat of the cart.             FRODOIt's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!(CONTINUED)11.
CONTINUED:Next to GANDALF, we see how small HOBBITS are ... FRODO is 3foot 6 inches tall.                       GANDALF          You didn't think I'd miss your          Uncle Bilbo’s birthday?EXT. HOBBITON FIELDS - DAYCUT TO:WIDE ON: The cart rattles past a FIELD LUPIN being tended byHOBBITS.                       FRODO          What's new in the world? Tell me          everything.ANGLE ON: GANDALF looks down at FRODO, a twinkle in his eye.                       GANDALF          What, everything? Far too eager and          curious for a Hobbit. Most unnatural...          Well, what can I tell you? Life in the          wide world goes on much as it has this          past age. Full of its own comings and          goings, scarcely even aware of the          existence of Hobbits...CLOSE ON: GANDALF as he surveys the peaceful scene before him.             GANDALF (CONT’D)...for which I am very thankful.So, how is the old rascal? I hearthis is to be a party of specialmagnificence.             FRODOYou know Bilbo. He’s got the wholeplace in an uproar.             GANDALFWell, that should please him.             FRODOHalf the Shire’s been invited. Andthe rest of them are turning up anyway.
