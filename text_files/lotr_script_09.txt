BILBO          I’ve got to get away from these          confounded relatives, hanging on the          bell all day, never giving me a moment's          peace. I want to see mountains again ...          mountains, Gandalf ... and then find          somewhere quiet where I can finish my          book ... oh, Tea!                       GANDALF          So, you mean to go through with yourplan, then?                       BILBO          Yes, yes ... it’s all in hand. All the          arrangements are made.                       GANDALF          Frodo suspects something.                       BILBO          ‘Course he does, he's a Baggins ... not          some blockheaded Bracegirdle from          Hardbottle!                       GANDALF          You will tell him, won't you?BILBOYes, yes.                       GANDALF          He’s very fond of you.                       BILBO          I know. He’d probably come with me if I          asked him. I think, in his heart,          Frodo’s still in love with the Shire,          the woods and the fields ... little          rivers.BILBO stands gazing out of the kitchen window.                       BILBO (CONT’D)          I am old, Gandalf...BILBO looks at GANDALF sadly...(CONTINUED)19.
CONTINUED: (3)                       BILBO (CONT’D)          I know I don’t look it, but I’m          beginning to feel it in my heart.CLOSE ON: BILBO’S fingers close around his waistcoat pocket ...gripping a small, unseen object.                       BILBO (CONT’D)          I feel thin ... sort of stretched, like          butter scraped over too much bread. I          need a holiday ... a very long holiday          and I don’t expect I shall return ...          in fact, I mean not to.INT. BAG END - EVENINGCUT TO:GANDALF and BILBO are sitting on the BAG END porch. BELOW THEM,final preparations are being made on the PARTY field. BILBOstrikes a match and lights his pipe.                       BILBO          Old Toby. The finest weed in the          Southfarthing!BILBO blows a perfect smoke ring and watches it rise into theair. A tiny sailing ship with masts and sails glides through theCENTER of BILBO’S smoke ring.                       BILBO (CONT’D)          Ohhhh.                (smiles)          Gandalf, my old friend ... this will          be a night to remember.EXT. PARTY FIELD, HOBBITON - NIGHTCUT TO:BOOM! A FIREWORK explodes into the night sky high above HOBBITON... in the shape of a great green tree with unfolding branches.TILT DOWN: with glowing flowers as they rain down from thebranches ... evaporating just above the upturned faces of thedelighted party-goers.
