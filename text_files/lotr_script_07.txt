 FRODO          Before you came along, we Bagginses          were very well thought of.                       GANDALFIndeed?                       FRODO          Never had any adventures or did          anything unexpected.                       GANDALF          If you're referring to the incident          with the Dragon ... I was barely          involved ...all I did was give your          uncle a little nudge out the door.                       FRODO          Whatever you did ... you’ve been          officially labeled a disturber of the          peace.GANDALFOh, really?ANGLE ON: ODO PROUDFOOT looks up as the CART passes by, deeplysuspicious.CUT TO:EXT. HOBBITON - DAYCRANE UP: EXCITED CHILDREN, chasing after the cart.CLOSE ON: GANDALF ignores the children’s cries. The childrenstand deflated, watching GANDALF disappear up the lane.AT THAT MOMENT: spinning balls of bright color suddenly leap outof the cart, fizzing over the heads of the delighted children.ANGLE ON: GANDALF smiling to himself, well pleased with hisjoke.ANGLE ON: ODO PROUDFOOT is unable to suppress a chuckle.FRODO stands up in the cart as GANDALF reigns in the HORSE.                       FRODO          Gandalf ... I'm glad you're back.(CONTINUED)15.
CONTINUED:FRODO leaps expertly from the cart. GANDALF smiles.                       GANDALF          So am I, dear boy...so am I.EXT. BAG END - DAYCUT TO:WIDE ON: GANDALF’S CART pulls up outside the gate to BAG END ...a particularly fine example of a HOBBIT HOLE, with a large roundfront door set into a grassy hillside. There is a sign on thegate which reads: “NO ADMITTANCE EXCEPT ON PARTY BUSINESS.”GANDALF strides up the garden path of BAG END. He raises hisstaff and raps on the front door ... a voice calls out:                       BILBO (O.S.)          No thank you! We don't want any more          visitors, well-wishers, or distant          relations.                       GANDALF          And what about very old friends?Suddenly the door opens and BILBO BAGGINS stands before him. Heis a HOBBIT OF INDETERMINATE AGE, with a mischeivous TWINKLE inhis eye. Wearing a dashing brocade waist coat, he look everyinch the eccentric gentleman.BILBOGandalf?                       GANDALF          Bilbo Baggins!                       BILBO          My dear Gandalf!GANDALF drops to his knee to embrace his old friend.                       GANDALF          Good to see you. One hundred and eleven          years old, who would believe it?GANDALF looks at him more keenly.
