 BILBO          What business is it of yours what I do          with my own things?BILBO’S voice, shape and manner have suddenly changed.                       GANDALF          I think you've had that ring quitelong enough.                       BILBO          You want it for yourself!GANDALF rises to his full height, his eyes flash, his shadowsuddenly seems to fill the room.                       GANDALF          Bilbo Baggins, do not take me for some          conjurer of cheap tricks!BILBO cowers from GANDALF, disarmed by his power ... afrightened HOBBIT. GANDALF’S expression softens.                       GANDALF (CONT’D)          I am not trying to rob you. I am trying          to help you.Sobbing, BILBO runs to GANDALF and hugs him.                       GANDALF (CONT’D)          All your long years we’ve been friends          ... trust me as you once did. Let it          go!                       BILBO          You're right, Gandalf. The Ring must go          to Frodo.BILBO lifts his knapsack and heads for the front door.                       BILBO (CONT’D)          It's late, the road is long ... yes, itis time.Bilbo?Hmmm?GANDALFBILBO(CONTINUED)29.
CONTINUED: (3)                       GANDALF          The Ring is still in your pocket.BILBO hesitates ... reaches into his pocket.                       BILBOOh, yes.CLOSE ON: BILBO pulls out the ring ... he stares at it in hispalm. With all his will power, BILBO allows the ring to slowlyslide off his palm and drop to the floor.CLOSE ON: The tiny ring lands with a heavy thud on the woodenfloor.EXT. BAG END - NIGHTANGLE ON: BILBO staggering out of BAG END ... he braces himselfin the night air, PALE and TREMBLING, as if his loss of the ringhas weakened him. GANDALF steps up behind.                       BILBO          I've thought up an ending for my          book... “And he lived happily ever          after to the end of his days.”                       GANDALF          I'm sure you will, my dear friend.                       BILBO          Goodbye, Gandalf.                       GANDALF          Goodbye, Bilbo.BILBO walks away from BAG END, disappearing into the night,softly singing: “The Road goes on and on.”             GANDALF (CONT’D)      (softly)Until our next meeting.
