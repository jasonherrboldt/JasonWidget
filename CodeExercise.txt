Hiring Code Exercise
-----------------------------

Activity:
-------------
This task is designed to give us a manageable view of your coding ability
and style. The intent is to keep the scope simple and the time to complete short so
take care to not over-design or go too far with features not specifically requested.

Requirements:
-------------
The produced code should meet the following requirements:
 * Written in Java
 * Code should be reasonably covered by JUnit-based unit tests using Mockito for any
   required Mocking.
 * Code should be reasonably well documented (JavaDoc, minimal inline if something
   is not self-documenting)
 * Code should log via Log4J.
 * Solution should be multi-threaded.
 * Solution should employ generics in some way.
 * Solution should employ some form of Collection in processing.

The Project:
-------------
Design, code a deliver a simple widget that scans an input folder taking in each
individual file as a job. Input folder can be specified on the command-line or in a
properties file. For each file the code should read in the contents and
replace all instances of certain text strings with alternative text strings. These
replacement keys and values can be hard-coded or read in from properties. The
resulting modified text should be output to a configured output folder with an
extension appended to the filename to indicate processed. Aside from any debug logging
the tool should log at INFO level a line for each file successfully processed.

Delivery:
-------------
 * Code should be set up with a pom.xml to use MVN for build.
 * Include a small README that instructs how the code should be executed.
 * Finished code should be uploaded to a personal GitHub account and made available
   to our staff. (Create a new free account if you do not already have one)
 * Code should be delivered no later than 1 business day prior to in-person interview.

Thanks and happy coding!
